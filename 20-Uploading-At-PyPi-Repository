PyPi vs. Test PyPi
Note that pypi.org and test.pypy.org are two different websites.
You'll need to register separately at each website. If you only register at pypi.org, you will not be able to upload to the test.pypy.org repository.

Also, remember that your package name must be unique. If you use a package name that is already taken, you will get an error when trying to upload the package.

Structure of your folder:
      distributions
          file-1.py
          file-2.py
          __init__.py
      setup.py
            This will have details like following:
      license.txt
          It can have your copyright symbol and name etc
          Also any license you want to put in
      README.md
      setup.cfg
            [metadata]
            description-file = README.md


Summary of the Terminal Commands Used:
      cd <folder having above files and folders>
      > python setup.py sdist
             This will make some new files in directory like:
                  dist folder -> Will have tar.gz file. This is the file that needs to be uploaded.
                  distributions.egg.info file.
      > pip install twine
      > twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*

You can now donload this in your projects:
      > pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ dsnd-probability
      
      Now you can test this package and when you find everythi g is Ok. And, you are ready to upload on regular PyPi site, do it as follows.
   
   
# command to upload to the pypi repository
      > twine upload dist/*
      
      Uninstall earlier version to test new one from regular PyPi site:
            > pip uninstall distributions
      
      Install from regular Pypi repo:
            This is just like you install any regular package eg:
            > pip install distributions
 
 
 
 To use anywhere in your new program:
      You already installed it using > pip install distributions
      In your program: 
            from distributions import Gaussian, Binomial
            Gaussian(10,7)
            All these will work now!
 
 
 
 ** Note: Instead of distributions, you need to use a different name for this if you want to upload on PyPi.
 
 ** Note: If you need to change name again, then you need to delete dist folder and egg.info file. And, then update your project and. reate these files again.
 
 ** Note: When you are pip installing, you need to use - sign if it is in package. But in program you use _ (underscore). 
      This isactually because the PyPi website stores names of package with hyphen signs.
 
 ** In python3, command to run the setup.py is slightly different:
      > python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
      The difference is that you will get both a .tar.gz file and a .whl file. 
      The .tar.gz file is called a source archive whereas the .whl file is a built distribution. 
      The .whl file is a newer type of installation file for Python packages. 
      When you pip install a package, pip will first look for a whl file (wheel file) and if there isn't one, will then look for the tar.gz file.
