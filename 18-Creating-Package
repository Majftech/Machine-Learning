Installing a package: 
Eg.
pip install scikit-learn
If you do this, pip will bring said package from online repository Pypi

What is pip?
Pip is a Python package manager that helps with installing and uninstalling Python packages. You might have used pip to install packages using the 
command line: pip install numpy. When you execute a command like pip install numpy, 
pip will download the package from a Python package repository called PyPi.

Making a Package
In the previous section, the Distribution and Gaussian code was refactored into individual modules. A Python module is just a Python file containing code.

In this next section, you'll convert the Distributions code into a Python package. A package is a collection of Python modules. 
Although the previous code might already seem like it was a Python package because it contained multiple files, a Python package also needs 
an __init__.py file. 
In this section, you'll learn how to create this __init__.py file and then pip install the package into your local Python installation.


Make a directory: Eg. python_package_example
In this create:
    1. distributions folder. It has 3 files.
            1. GeneralDistribution.py file having Distribution class
            2. GaussianDistribution.py having Gaussian class
                    Also, since it uses above class so it should have one line:
                    from .GeneralDistribution import Distribution.  (Dot . is required in Python 3, but not in python 2)
            3. __init__.py.  
                    This file in a directory tells python that it is a distribution.
                    This is run as soon as you import a package
                    This can be empty.
                    It can have some code to ease during usage of the package
                        eg. from .GaussianDistribution import Gaussian
                        If we do not add this line, then program that use it il have to write:
                              from distributions.GaussianDistribution import Gaussian
    2. setup.py
                This is necessary for pip installing. It has information or metadata of package
    
    
  To install this package:
      cd to folder having distributions folderr and setup.py file
      > pip install .
                This will install the package
  
  
  Use this package:
        You can test this on python interpreter itself. You can be at any folder, since it is already installed.
        >>> from distributions import Gaussian
        >>> gaussian_one = Gaussian(22,2)
        >>> print(gaussian_one.mean)
        >>> 22
        
 To know path where it gets installed:
        >>> import distributions
        >>> distributions.__file__
        >>> 'opt/conda/lib/python-3.6/site-packages-distributions/__init__.py'
